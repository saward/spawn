## 1. Definitions  

1.1 **“Contribution”** means any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions to an existing work, that You intentionally submit to the Project Lead for inclusion in any project owned or managed by the Project Lead (the **“Work”**). “Submit” covers any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project Lead or its representatives—such as patches, Git commits, issues, and pull requests—except material conspicuously marked **“Not a Contribution”**.

1.2 **“Contributor”** includes both individuals and legal entities. For a legal entity, “Contributor” encompasses all entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. “Control” means (i) the power to direct management or policies, or (ii) ownership of ≥ 50 % of voting securities.

## 2. Copyright Licence  

Subject to this Agreement, You grant the Project Lead, and all recipients of software distributed by the Project Lead:

> a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable** copyright licence to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and **re-license** Your Contribution and derivative works under any terms the Project Lead chooses.

---

## 2A. Moral-Rights Consent (where applicable)  

To the fullest extent permitted by law, You **irrevocably consent** to any act or omission by the Project Lead or its licensees that would otherwise infringe Your moral rights (including rights of attribution and integrity).

---

## 3. Patent Licence  

Subject to this Agreement, You grant the Project Lead and all recipients of software distributed by the Project Lead a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable** patent licence to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work.  
This licence applies only to claims You can license that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or in combination with the Work.

**Patent-retaliation clause.** If any entity brings a patent action against the Project Lead or any downstream recipient alleging that the Work (or a Contribution) infringes a patent, the patent licences granted under this Agreement to that entity **terminate** as of the date such action is filed.

---

## 4. Contributor Representations  

You represent and warrant that:

* **4.1** You are legally entitled to grant the above licences. If Your employer or another entity owns intellectual-property rights in Your Contributions, You have—before making a Contribution—received permission to do so **or** that employer/entity has executed this same CLA.  
* **4.2** Each Contribution is Your original creation **or** You have identified any third-party source, licence, or restriction clearly in the submission.  
* **4.3** You will promptly notify the Project Lead if You learn of any facts that would make these representations inaccurate.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranty  

Unless required by applicable law or agreed in writing, the Work and Contributions are **provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind**, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

---

## 6. Support  

You are **not required** to provide support for Your Contributions. Any support You choose to offer is entirely at Your discretion.

## 7. General Terms  

* **7.1 Governing law / forum.** This Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of its courts.  
* **7.2 Entire agreement.** This is the entire agreement between You and the Project Lead concerning Contributions to the Work; it supersedes any prior agreements or understandings on the subject matter.  
* **7.3 Severability.** If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.  
* **7.4 Amendment.** The Project Lead may modify this Agreement by publishing a new version in the repository; new Contributions are accepted only under the then-current version. _There is only ever one active version at a time._
