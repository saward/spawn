<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Programmable SQL" icon="puzzle">
    Stop writing repetitive scripts. Use **variables, loops, and logic** (via Minijinja) to generate complex migrations, handle multi-tenancy, and inject external data sources.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Component-Based" icon="pencil">
    Treat your database code like app code. Edit Views and Functions **in-place** within a `components/` folder. Spawn handles the history tracking for you.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Reproducible Builds" icon="document">
    Like a `Cargo.lock` for your database. Spawn **pins** your component versions for every migration, guaranteeing that historical scripts never break even as your schema evolves.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Integrated Testing" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Use macros to create reusable **data factories** directly in SQL. Spin up complex test scenarios with simple, readable logic—no external scripts required.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regression Assurance" icon="magnifier">
    Catch bugs before they merge. Run comprehensive test suites automatically in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure new migrations don't break existing functionality.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Zero Dependencies" icon="rocket">
    Built in **Rust**. A single binary that installs in seconds. No JVM, no Perl, no Python virtual environments required. Just `curl` and go.
  </Card>
