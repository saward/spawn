Spawn as a Databaes Build System enables a lot of helpful patterns to make managing a database easier. The recipes section is intended to highlight some of the more useful patterns we have come across that may make working with your database easier.

:::tip[Got a recipe suggestion?]
If you have a pattern you've found particularly helpful, share it in our [Show and Tell](https://github.com/saward/spawn/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) discussion board, and we may include it in a future iteration of these docs if we like it.
