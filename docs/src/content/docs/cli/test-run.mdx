<CLICommand
  usage="spawn test run [name]"
  options={[...databaseOption, ...globalOptions]}
>

Executes one or all tests against the configured database and displays the results.

## Arguments

- `[name]` — Optional. Specific test to run. If omitted, runs all tests in the `tests/` directory.

## Behavior

Each test runs in a transaction that is rolled back, ensuring tests don't affect the database state.

## Examples

Run a specific test:

```bash
spawn test run user-creation
```

Run all tests:

```bash
spawn test run
```
