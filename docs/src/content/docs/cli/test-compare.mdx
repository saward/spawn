  usage="spawn test compare <name>"
  options={[...databaseOption, ...globalOptions]}
>

Runs tests and compares their output against saved expected results, reporting any differences.

## Arguments

- `<name>` — Specific test to compare.

## Behavior

For each test:

1. Runs the test and captures output
2. Compares output to the `expected` file in the test directory
3. Reports differences (if any)

Use [`spawn test expect`](/cli/test-expect/) to update the expected output.

## Example

```bash
spawn test compare user-creation
```
