  usage="spawn test build <name>"

Renders a test's `test.sql` template into final SQL, resolving component includes and template variables. Outputs to stdout.

## Arguments

- `<name>` — The test directory name

## Behavior

Similar to [`spawn migration build`](/cli/migration-build/), but for tests. Processes the `test.sql` template and resolves any component includes or template logic.

## Example

```bash
spawn test build user-creation
```
