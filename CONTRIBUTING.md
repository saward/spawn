# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Spawn.

Spawn is an opinionated tool with a specific architectural vision. To ensure the project remains focused and maintainable, we ask that you follow the guidelines below.

### ⚠️ Important: Discuss First

**Please open an issue to discuss any changes before submitting a Pull Request.**

We prioritize features that align with the core "Database Build System" philosophy. Pull Requests submitted without a prior discussion or linked issue may be closed without review. This ensures we don't waste your time on work that cannot be merged.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue using the Bug Report template.

- Include your `spawn.toml` (redacted).
- Include the output of `spawn migration status`.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue.

### Proposing Features

Feature requests are welcome, but please verify they align with the project's scope (PostgreSQL-first, zero-abstraction). Please describe **the problem you are trying to solve**, not just the solution you want to implement.
